## Image Identification on AWS
### PROJECT PLAN and PROCEDURE

- Using ResNet-50, a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. We load a pretrained version of the neural network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database
- A client will upload images and the system will output the classification/object name and a confidence score for that classifcation.
- We intend to add elasticity on AWS, perhaps using containers if time allows.
