PROJECT PLAN and PROCEDURE

- We will find a image classification model
- Simulataneously we will configure the networjk and container resource to service the model.


- Initial model utilized:

ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. We loaded a pretrained version of the neural network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database
