PROJECT PLAN and PROCEDURE

- The group will choose an image classification model for common objects.
- We will upload images and the system will output the classification/object name and confidence score for that image.
- Provision the network and worker containers to service the model, using kubernetes for elasticity.

- Initial model utilized:

ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. We loaded a pretrained version of the neural network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database
